Arch Linux Arm is a great opeating system, but it lacks community support compared to other operating systems for ARM. Also some programs didn't work because of some package errors or because of the lack of packages, so I decided to fix that!
You know Pi-Apps is a great program created by Botspot (https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps), but it only works on Raspberry Pi Os/Ubuntu/Debian systems. To fix that, I wrote this simple program. 
Alarmapps will only work on 64 bit arch linux arm, and I only tested it on a raspberry pi. So use it on your own risk!

Just type this command to install:
```
wget -qO- https://github.com/JLCPi/alarmapps/raw/refs/heads/main/installalarmapps.sh | bash
```
This is my first serious project, expect bugs and errors.
